    <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="375" data-total-count="375">UNITED NATIONS — The United States ambassador to the United Nations, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/nikki_haley/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Nikki Haley." class="meta-per">Nikki R. Haley</a>, signaled on Wednesday morning that the Trump administration wanted to work with Russia to end the war in <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/syria/index.html?inline=nyt-geo" title="More news and information about Syria." class="meta-loc">Syria</a>. A few hours later, Ms. Haley drew a line in the diplomatic sand, forcing Russia to use its veto for an eighth time on a Syria resolution in the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/security_council/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Security Council, U.N." class="meta-org">United Nations Security Council</a>.</p>
    <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="277" data-total-count="652">The United States, France and Britain had sponsored a draft resolution that would have strengthened the ability of international investigators to look into the details of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/world/middleeast/syria-gas-attack.html">a chemical attack in Syria</a> on April 4. The resolution won 10 votes, but Russia vetoed it. China abstained.</p>
    <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="208" data-total-count="860">After the vote, Ms. Haley said she regretted that Russia had chosen to use its veto power for the eighth time to back the Syrian government. “By its failure Russia will continue to be isolated,” she said.</p>
    <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="353" data-total-count="1213">The measure condemned the chemical weapons attack, urged international investigators who were already authorized by the Security Council to look into it, and specifically reminded the Syrian government to cooperate, including by turning over all flight logs, flight plans and the names of commanders in charge of air operations on the day of the strike.</p>
    <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="369" data-total-count="1582">Russia objected to the draft when it was first brought up last week, and on Wednesday it dismissed the resolution as a political tool. Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said his government wanted what it called “an honest investigation.” Russia drafted an alternate resolution but did not put it up for a vote.</p>
    <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="115" data-total-count="1697" id="story-continues-1">The Russian deputy ambassador, Vladimir Safronkov, testily said that the resolution had “an anti-Syrian slant.”</p>
    <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="113" data-total-count="1810">Ms. Haley pointed out that the resolution simply reiterated what the Syrian government was already obliged to do.</p>
    <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="403" data-total-count="2213">A fact-finding team of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has already been assigned to look into whether chemical weapons were used in Syria. A separate team has been authorized by the Security Council to determine who is using those weapons, banned by international law, and concluded that the Syrian government has used banned chemical weapons; Russia criticized that conclusion.</p>
    <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="317" data-total-count="2530">The United States dismissed a compromise measure that several other countries on the council had tried to advance last week. It left out the specific reminder to the Syrian government to turn over flight logs. The United States and its two major Western allies, Britain and France, insisted on that specific language.</p>
    <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="444" data-total-count="2974" id="story-continues-2">Earlier on Wednesday, Ms. Haley struck a different tone. Speaking at another briefing at the Security Council while Secretary of State <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/t/rex_w_tillerson/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Rex W. Tillerson." class="meta-per">Rex W. Tillerson</a> was meeting with President <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/vladimir_v_putin/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Vladimir V. Putin." class="meta-per">Vladimir V. Putin</a> of Russia, Ms. Haley reserved her sharpest barbs for Iran, which she accused of using the Syrian war to expand its own influence in the region, and she urged Russia to “stop covering for Assad,” referring to President <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/bashar_al_assad/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Bashar Al-Assad." class="meta-per">Bashar al-Assad</a> of Syria.</p>
    <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="117" data-total-count="3091">“We are ready to throw our weight and resources behind diplomacy,” Ms. Haley said. She did not offer any details.</p>
    <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="171" data-total-count="3262" data-node-uid="1">The United Nations envoy in charge of mediating Syria talks, Staffan de Mistura, said on Wednesday that the next round could begin in May, without offering a precise date.</p>
